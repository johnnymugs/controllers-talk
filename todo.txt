1) see if you can re-organize the big dteails vs small details discussion

Every controller does one "big thing" -- it create or updates or fetches a resource
But all these little details matter: auth, auth, response, etc

2) see if you can talk about habbits sooner

3) double check codez

4) try to emphasize that the important part is adjusting thinking, not copying these shared examples

5) make sure conclusion is solid
